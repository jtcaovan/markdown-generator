# markdown editor

![Design preview for the In-browser markdown editor coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this in-browser markdown editor and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

Your users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
